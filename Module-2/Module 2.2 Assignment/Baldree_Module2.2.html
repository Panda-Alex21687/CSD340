        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            My name is Alexander Baldree, and I currently live in Memphis, Tennessee. I grew up enjoying hands-on activities and learning how things work from an early age. <span class="sentence">This curiosity shaped my interest in technology and problem-solving.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            I work two jobs while pursuing my degree in Software Development, which has taught me strong time management and discipline. Balancing work and school can be challenging, but it keeps me motivated and focused on my long-term goals. Education is a priority for me because it opens doors to better opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hobbies change with the seasons, but I enjoy hiking, biking, and spending time outdoors whenever possible. I also have a strong interest in mechanics and computers, especially projects that allow me to build or fix things. These activities help me stay mentally engaged and creative.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family is important to me, and I value the support system I have around me. I believe hard work and persistence are key to success in both personal and professional life. Through this course, I hope to strengthen my web development skills and apply them in real-world projects.
        </p>
